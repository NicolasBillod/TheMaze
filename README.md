# TheMaze

Little game created while getting started with Unity (version 5.4.3). You start in a safe zone, centered in the middle of 4 different mazes and you have to collect an artifact in each maze to unlock the door to end the game. Ennemy agents roam in the mazes and attack you if they see you (larger field of detection during the night). You can interact with the world using the pointer at the center of the screen: fire arrows, use your sword, put tags (and remove them) on the walls, eat the food on the floor, pick up artifacts.
Using the tab key, you can see the map. Everytime you visit a new room (for the mazes with rooms), it updates this map.
This video, in french, gives a tour of the interactions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWrnEgRfGU8

This game is the result of a project we worked on during our Master's degree at UPMC (Pierre et Marie Curie University) within the EVIJV course, Paris, in 2017-2018.
